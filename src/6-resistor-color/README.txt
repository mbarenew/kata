In this exercise you are going to create a helpful program so that you don't have to remember the values of the bands.

These colors are encoded as follows:

Black: 0
Brown: 1
Red: 2
Orange: 3
Yellow: 4
Green: 5
Blue: 6
Violet: 7
Grey: 8
White: 9
The goal of this exercise is to create a way:

to look up the numerical value associated with a particular color band
to list the different band colors
Mnemonics map the colors to the numbers, that, when stored as an array, happen to map to their index in the array: Better Be Right Or Your Great Big Values Go Wrong.
